### <strong>Description</strong>

This little project is here to teach you the basics: you will learn about these risks and vulnerabilities while auditing a simple website. This website shows breaches, some of which still show on well established websites you visit on a daily basis. Here is a major introduction to general vulnerabilities you will face on the World Wide Web.

> *Project en collaboration avec <a href="https://github.com/AcensJJ">Jean-Jacques Acens</a> (<a href="https://profile.intra.42.fr/users/jacens">jacens</a>).*

# Mandatory part 

- Your turn-in folder will only include the things that allowed you to solve each of the exploited breaches.
- Your repository will look like this:

```IMG```

- If you need a specific file included on the project ISO, you will have to download it during the evaluation. You must not put it in your repo, under any circumstances.
- If youâ€™re using a specific external software, you will have to set the specific required environment (VM, docker, Vagrant).
- For the mandatory part, you will have to complete 14 different breaches.
- During the evaluation, you may be required to fix the breaches you have exploited. Understanding what you exploit is, of course, strongly recommended.
- Explaining what you do often is more important than the exploitation itself. Take time to understand, and make sure you are understood.
